<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository was created with the purpose of assisting you with either tips or resources to create fantastic UIs.

* As a developer, your time should be dedicated towards programming and learning. Not all of us want to be designers, but sometimes we have to work on the visual part of the projects as well.
* UI is not just the looks of an application. UI includes UX. Every time a user interacts with your application, they should already be comfortable with your functionalities and know what each button is supposed to do.
* UI Design is NOT always font combinations, a good choice of color palette and advanced concepts and principles of art and design. Sometimes it's just CONSISTENCY.
* Overloading the UI with things you don't understand or don't know how to combine just yet is a bad practice. Constistency is easy to achieve and will bring immediate good results.
* Just like in development, you don't need to reinvent the wheel. Make use of available resources out there on the Internet. There are multiple FREE resources ready to be implemented in your projects. For example, we can make use of free icons available to us. They can take any form, from simple .svg / .png images, to HTML <i></i> elements from libraries of icons, such as FontAwesome or BootstrapIcons, to JSX components which you can copy to clipboard and paste in your projects.

### What to expect

This repository contains information and resources to help you create good UIs for your projects. 

As I do not have any experience with applications outside of the web, I recommend you to stick to general tips and guidance and apply them to your projects in the way you find suitable. 

For example, for the UI of a desktop application, if you'd like to add an icon to a button, I suppose you'd save the image of the icon, add it to your project folder and use some kind of class methods to display that icon within the button.

You can use the Table of Contents to navigate to each section of interest.

Feel free to contribute with anything you think it's missing to help other developers or students.
