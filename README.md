<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This repository was created with the purpose of assisting you with either tips or resources to create fantastic UIs.

* As a developer, your time should be dedicated towards programming and learning. Not all of us want to be designers, but sometimes we have to work on the visual part of the projects as well.
* UI is not just the looks of an application. UI includes UX. Every time a user interacts with your application, they should already be comfortable with your functionalities and know what each button is supposed to do.
* UI Design is NOT always font combinations, a good choice of color palette and advanced concepts and principles of art and design. Sometimes it's just CONSISTENCY.
* Overloading the UI with things you don't understand or don't know how to combine just yet is a bad practice. Constistency is easy to achieve and will bring immediate good results.
* Just like in development, you don't need to reinvent the wheel. Make use of available resources out there on the Internet. There are multiple FREE resources ready to be implemented in your projects. For example, we can make use of free icons available to us. They can take any form, from simple .svg / .png images, to HTML <i></i> elements from libraries of icons, such as FontAwesome or BootstrapIcons, to JSX components which you can copy to clipboard and paste in your projects.

### What to expect

This repository contains information and resources to help you create good UIs for your projects. 

As I do not have any experience with applications outside of the web, I recommend you to stick to general tips and guidance and apply them to your projects in the way you find suitable. 

For example, for the UI of a desktop application, if you'd like to add an icon to a button, I suppose you'd save the image of the icon, add it to your project folder and use some kind of class methods to display that icon within the button.

You can use the Table of Contents to navigate to each section of interest.

Feel free to contribute with anything you think it's missing to help other developers or students.

<!-- BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES -->
## Basic Design Principles

### Contrast

Defined as the difference between elements within a design that makes them stand out from each other, contrast plays an important role in the visibility of each element. 

You should (almost) never put a blue text on a slightly lighter blue background. It affects the text's readability. 

Of course, you could bring the color of text closer to the background color to suggest that the text is secondary, informational and doesn't play a very important role in transmitting a message, but even it this situation, it should still be visible and readable for the user.

### Proportion

Refers to the size of the elements in relation to each other. Proportion and scale are important in hierarchy as well, as larger elements tend to appear more important.

Use proportion and scale in your advantage and define important elements, such as CTAs (Call to Actions) using scale, color, or shape.

### Hierarchy

We place elements accordingly based on levels of importance. You should also provide a visual solutions to this. A simple example would be making the title large (24px) in contrast to the paragraph of text (12px).

### White-Space

White-space is an important element in most designs. We can define empty spaces on a page on each side, left and right, and keep all the content in the center. For a blog post, this would allow the user to focus on the text, the most important element of an article, and it could be a solution to shorter lines of text, which are easier to follow.

For example, it's easier to read lines that are 8-12 words in length. We can easily follow to the next line and keep track of where we are in the article. It's harder to read text which has lines that are, for example, 24-28 words in length.

White space can also be a good separator between elements or clusters of elements (see <a href="#unity">Unity</a>).

### Unity

Defining clusters of elements that are related to each other offers a solid structure to your interface. For example, you should always stick all important elements related to navigation to the navbar / header menu, or, usually, you would keep the Login / Sign Up buttons together, not spread apart from each other.

__

These are 5 principles which I think you can easily apply to your projects for fast and clear improvements to the UI. There are 12 principles in total, and if you'd like to learn more about them, I strongly recommend a Google search.

All of these principles are:

1. Contrast
2. Balance
3. Emphasis
4. Proportion
5. Hierarchy
6. Repetition
7. Rhythm
8. Pattern
9. White space
10. Movement
11. Variety
12. Unity
